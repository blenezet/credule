A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a financial swap agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer (usually the creditor of the reference loan) in the event of a loan default (by the debtor) or other credit event. This is to say that the seller of the CDS insures the buyer against some reference loan defaulting. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS "fee" or "spread") to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults. It was invented by Blythe Masters from JP Morgan in 1994.

April 8 2009 saw a "Big Bang" in the market for credit default swap (CDS) contracts and the way in which they are traded. Both contract and convention
changes were implemented simultaneously. These changes were designed to
make CDS more standardised to help support efforts for central clearing of
CDS trades, make strides towards T+0 trade processing and facilitate
operational efficiency.

The CDS "Big Bang" has introduced standardized coupon dates and maturity dates. The functions provided in this package do not use these "new" conventions (i.e. they use the conventions pre-April 2008); therefore it's not recommended to use them in a production context. In most cases the differences are marginal, therefore these functions are good enough for preliminary research. 

Note. I'm planning to update this package with proper CDS ISDA conventions handling at a later stage.
